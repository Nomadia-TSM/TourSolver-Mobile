### 5. Productivity Tips

Here are some tips to help you maximize your efficiency with TourSolver Mobile/Calendar:

*   **Visualize Your Route with Map View**: Always check the **Map view** at the start of your day for a quick visual overview of your planned route, total duration, and distance. This helps you mentally prepare for your travel.
*   **Utilize Full-Screen Map Mode**: In map view, tap the **full screen button** on the top right to see both the map and intervention cards simultaneously. You can then **swipe the cards right or left** to cycle through your different interventions while still seeing their locations on the map.
    *   💡 *Tip*: If you ever lose your place on the map, tap the **GPS icon** below the full screen button to zoom back to your current location. Tap the **inward arrow** to exit full screen and return to the map-only view.
*   **Stay Updated with "Update My Agenda"**: Regularly use the **Update my agenda button** in the filter menu to ensure your calendar reflects the latest changes from your planner. This prevents missing new assignments or changes to existing ones.
*   **Quickly Find Interventions with Search**: If you have a busy schedule, the **Search for an intervention** feature is a powerful tool to quickly locate specific tasks by name, number, date, or address.
*   **Understand Status Colors at a Glance**: Familiarize yourself with the **Color Legend**. This allows you to quickly understand the status of each intervention (e.g., awaiting, accepted, in progress, completed, refused, abandoned) just by looking at the colored circle on the card.
*   **Use Filters for Focused Views**: Depending on your needs, switch between **Day view, Week view, or List view** using the filter button. This helps you focus on relevant information without being overwhelmed.
